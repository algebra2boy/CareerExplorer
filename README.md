# About

This is my first web app, written in Svelte 5. The website takes a keyword, location, radius, and number of results as inputs to call the CareerOneStop API, generating real-life job postings. I learned several new concepts from Svelte 5, such as $state, $effect, $props, and store management. This was also my first time deploying to Vercel. The process was easier than I anticipated, though it took me five attempts to deploy successfully, which required using the correct Node.js runtime, removing the package-lock.json from the root directory, and choosing the Vercel adapter.
